## Abstract: 
This project aims to design and develop an intelligent chatbot that utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to facilitate effective human-computer interaction. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of frequently asked questions and responses, enabling it to understand and respond to user queries accurately.
The project employs various NLTK techniques, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, to preprocess and normalize user input. The chatbot's architecture is based on a machine learning model that utilizes supervised learning algorithms to learn from the training data.
The developed chatbot is evaluated on its performance, accuracy, and response time, demonstrating its potential to provide efficient and effective support for various applications, including customer service, language translation, and information retrieval.

Keywords: AI Chatbot, NLTK, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction.
